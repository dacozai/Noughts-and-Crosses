# Noughts-and-Crosses
This is the environment for noughts and crosses(Tic-Tac-Toe).
I will publish my dissertation sooner or later, and this is the environment that I test my agents.

The environment is designed to exmaine the learning of reinforcement learning agents and meta-learning agents.

```bash
cd unit-test
python3 board_test.py
python3 gomoku_test.py
